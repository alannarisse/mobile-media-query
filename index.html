      <h2>Trees</h2>
      <p>A tree frog (or treefrog) is any species of frog that spends a major portion of its lifespan in trees, known as an arboreal state.[1] Several lineages of frogs among the Neobatrachia suborder have given rise to treefrogs, although they are not closely related to each other.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dark-green box">
      <h2>Evolution</h2>
      <p>Millions of years of convergent evolution have resulted in very similar morphology even in species that are not very closely related. Furthermore, tree frogs in seasonally arid environments have adapted an extra-epidermal layer of lipid and mucus as an evolutionary convergent response to accommodate the periodic dehydration stress.</p>
